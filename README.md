# OpenModelica Launcher App

## Objective
This project is a PyQt6-based desktop application that launches OpenModelica simulation models with user-defined start and stop times. It provides a simple GUI to select compiled models, validate inputs, and execute simulations efficiently.

Direct executable available in the `launcher_exe` folder.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- PyQt6
- OpenModelica
- Windows 10/11

## Features
- Select executable file
- Enter start time
- Enter stop time
- Validate inputs
- Execute OpenModelica model

## Impact
This tool simplifies the execution of OpenModelica simulation models by providing a user-friendly interface, reducing manual command-line usage and minimizing input errors during simulation setup.  

## Validation Condition
Start time and stop time must satisfy:

0 ≤ start time < stop time ≤ 5

## How to Run
1. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Open terminal in app folder:
   python main.py

## Folder Structure
- app/main.py
- model_files/
- requirements.txt

## Known Issues
- The OpenModelica model may show division-by-zero warnings depending on model parameters.
- Some OpenModelica runtime DLL files may be required locally for the executable to run.

## Future Improvements
- Add dark/light mode toggle
- Add drag-and-drop support for executable files
- Add execution history
- Add graphical display of simulation results
- Add support for multiple OpenModelica models
  
## Run Directly Using Executable

If you do not want to run the Python code manually, you can use the executable version:

1. Open the `launcher_exe` folder
2. Download `main.exe`
3. Double-click `main.exe` to launch the application
   
 ## Important Note for Executable Users

When downloading `main.exe`, your browser or Windows may show a warning because `.exe` files are not commonly downloaded.

This is normal.

To run the application:

1. Download `main.exe`
2. Keep the file if your browser shows a warning
3. Double-click `main.exe`
4. If Windows shows a security warning, click:

   - Run anyway
